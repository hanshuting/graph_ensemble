structSearchInstance.m creates a batch of 100 models (trials) of a given type.
It takes as input the number of nodes and the number of variables, while
the other model aspects, such as graph type, etc. can be set by modifying  
the mtype Hashtable in that function.

logisticRegBoyd.m implements the ell_1 penalized logistic regression.
It is a wrapper for code by Koh, Kim and Boyd. The binaries of their code 
for your platform can be downloaded from http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/l1_logreg/ 

gibbs_mex.cpp needs to be compiled using mex.

containing the model parameter settings.

starmarg.m implements belief propagation for star graphs.
